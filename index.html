                <div class="about-content">
                    <div class="about-text">
                        <p>TextParade was founded by Xander Mitchell and Noah Lee, two passionate Chicago-based student educators and college history majors. We started this project with the deep belief that physical textbooks generate stronger learning outcomes.</p>
                        <p>Textbooks are today both expensive and unavailable. Their rapid increase in price has completely outpaced the CPI for other goods and for that reason and others, the purchasing of new textbooks has become prohibitively expensive for school districts regardless of textbook benefits.</p>
                        <p>Even though both educators and students recognize the value in textbooks—such as less eye strain, reliability, and information retention—districts and individual schools are pushing teachers to develop independent curriculums in part to skip out on this cost. As textbook prices rises and the shift to digital resources continues, we are finding solutions to ensure textbooks have a place in the classroom.</p>
